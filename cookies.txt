Cookies
_______________

-> cookie is a second way of transfering data between classes by using response redirect. 

-> cookie acts as a token to trasfer a string type data for each travel of response.

-> in java cookie is a class from javax.servlet.http.cookie.

-> constructor of cookie accepts string name and string value as an argument.

-> after we are done creating a cookie object a method called addcookie() which accepts object of cookie as an argument from response object is called t0 add cookie inside response

-> as we know the response gets converted to request and is redirected to following servlet classes 

-> to access cookie object we have a method called getcookies() from cookies object which returns array of cookie (cookie[])

->to read the data from cookie object we have a method called getname() which returns the name of cookie and this name can be used to identify the required cookie

->after we get required cookie we have a method called get value which is used to return data or value inside cookie object

->both of this getname() and getvalue() are non static methods from cookie class.




Disadvantages of Cookies
_________________________

->the data transfer using cookie object is accessible in web browser as web  browser has a feature of saving a cookie.

->by using cookie we can transfer only string type data.

->transfering the data using cookie object is inefficient  as cookie can transfer for only one instance and then to transfer the data between servlet class a cookie has to travel with req as well as with response.




note
____


->getcookies() method from req object returns array of cookie contains cookies from previous class as well as cookies those are saved in  web browser


->setmaxage().



->url rewriting.
